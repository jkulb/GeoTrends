# GeoTrends
This code takes two user input words (or phrases), looks them up on google trends, then prints a world map color coded by which countries google which term more. 
The default time period is 3 months but you can change that in line #8. Inspired by a TikTok I saw of a map of Barbie/Oppenheimer search results in the US and how it 
was correlated with each state's political allignment - play around with different inputs and maybe you'll notice something similar on a global scale
